## All For One Build

## Description: Created a frontend application that calls on an API I created to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript. It is connected through fetches that calls to the API. The project consists of 10 mini challenges that the User can play with through inputs. The project is also responsive and built using Tailwind CSS.

## Peer Review Vanessa Acuna: The functionally of the app worked well.
